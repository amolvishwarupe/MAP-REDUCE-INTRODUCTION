Name node
The NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system. 
It keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system,
and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept. 
It does not store the data of these files itself.

Data node

A DataNode stores data in the [HadoopFileSystem].
 A functional filesystem has more than one DataNode, 
with data replicated across them. On startup, 
a DataNode connects to the NameNode; spinning until that service comes up. 
It then responds to requests from the NameNode for filesystem operations

Resource Manager
The ResourceManager (RM) is responsible for tracking the resources in a cluster, 
and scheduling applications (e.g., MapReduce jobs). Prior to Hadoop 2.4,
the ResourceManager is the single point of failure in a YARN cluster.

Node manager
The NodeManager (NM) is YARN’s per-node agent, 
and takes care of the individual compute nodes in a Hadoop cluster. 
This includes keeping up-to date with the ResourceManager (RM), overseeing containers’ 
life-cycle management; monitoring resource usage (memory, CPU) of individual containers, 
tracking node-health, log’s management and auxiliary services which may be exploited by different YARN applications.
